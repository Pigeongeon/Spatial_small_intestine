# Spatial_small_intestine
Code for CODEX data


This resource provides the R code to reproduce key results described in Harnik*, Yakubovsky*, Hoefflin* et al. "A spatial expression atlas of the adult human proximal small intestine".
The necessary matrices can be found on zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10724499

File description:

1. "github_duodenum.R": Code
